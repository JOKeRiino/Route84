            This game serves as a simple representation and showcase for the JavaScript library "kaboom.js."<br>
            It runs on JavaScript only and is rendered by the HTML canvas element. Almost all sprites in this<br>
            game were made by me. This is my first try at making a (browser) game.<br><br>

            Currently, Route84 is in alpha stage (Version: 0.7.1), therefore has some bugs and does not<br>feature mobile support. <br><br>
            If you find any bugs you can tell me on <a href="https://github.com/JOKeRiino/Route84" target="_blank">Github.</a>
             (And also follow the project if interested!)

        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your goal is to refuel the cars. If a car stops at a gas pump, click on it to reveal the<br>refueling minigame.</li>
            <li>To beat the minigame, spam [SPACEBAR] repeatedly and keep the yellow fuel level within the<br>green bar (Watch out for the BORDERS!).</li>
            <li>Buy upgrades to level up and therefore earn more money from fueling up cars.</li>
            <li>The Clerk is a donkey.</li>
            <li>Have fun :)</li>
