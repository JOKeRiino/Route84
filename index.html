        <h1>Route84</h1>
        <p>
            This game serves as a simple representation and showcase for the JavaScript library "kaboom.js."<br>
            It runs on JavaScript only and is rendered by the HTML canvas element. Almost all sprites in this<br>
            game were made by me. This is my first try at making a (browser) game.<br><br>

            Currently, Route84 is in alpha stage (Version: 0.7.0), therefore has some bugs and does not<br>feature mobile support. <br><br>
            If you find any bugs you can tell me on <a href="https://github.com/JOKeRiino/littlegasstation-main" target="_blank">Github.</a>
             (And also follow the project if interested!)
            <br>
            If you want to give general feedback, you can do that on <a href="https://twitter.com/riino_dev" target="_blank">Twitter.</a>

            Also, if you enjoyed the game, you can send me some doge coin <a href="https://freewallet.org/id/f113cd16/doge" target="_blank">here.</a>
